This Repo is sorted from courses I took at UC, Berkeley  in Fall17.
Note: The arrangement is not simply due to the course syllabus. I mean to reorder all the course notes, discussions and homework in order to form a structure of machine learning basis illustrate with adequate projects and datasets.

Most of my summaries come from the wisdom of dear Prof. Yu and Prof. Sahai along with their outstanding TA group.
